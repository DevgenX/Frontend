## Purpose of Flatsocial & How to get started

The reason for flatsocial was to create an online space for those attending flatiron. Currently we use slack, but we thought it would be cool to have something more personal to flatiron. In order to use Flatsocail, you will need to fork and clone the frontend and backend. For the backend, you will open VS with `code .`. You will need to run `bundle install` to grab the necesarry gems, then open a terminal in rails and you will type `rails server` to launch the server for the backend. For the frontend you will cd into the frontend and type `npm install`, to install the necesarry components, then npm start to launch the frontend in the browser.
